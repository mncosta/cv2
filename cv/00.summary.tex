I'm a Postdoc researcher at the Technical University of Denmark, where I'm currently working on a framework for finding optimal climate adaptation policies through a combination of reinforcement learning and agent-based simulation. Delving deeper, this tool seeks to find dynamic links between flooding events, transport, health, and wellbeing and uncover how optimal adaptation policies can be discovered to maximize societal wellbeing. Previously, I obtained my PhD (\textit{magna cum laude}) in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Portugal, where I focused on understanding both objective and subjective urban cycling safety using a machine learning approach. My research focused on understanding and predicting how cyclists' safety is influenced by the context where cyclists cycle and the surrounding built environment.
