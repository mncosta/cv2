    Currently a PhD candidate at Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon, Portugal focusing on understanding both objective and subjective urban cycling safety. By applying data science, computer vision and machine learning to such an important area, I hope to create a platform for better understanding and predicting how cyclists interact with their surroundings. With a completed MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico, he then worked as a research fellow at the Institute for Systems and Robotics (ISR-IST) before starting his doctoral path.
